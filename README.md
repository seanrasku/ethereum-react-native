# ethereum-react-native

This project is a first draft of a larger project that will include a server and be hosted on AWS. This basic project is a fully front end React Native app that allows the user to connect to their wallet and send transactions to anyone they want. It is a more in depth version of a prior project I built in React, but contains much more detail in regards to UI and how data is received. This project uses useContext to avoid using asyncStorage, but once the project is meant for multiple users, and the login and sign up is working, then asyncStorage must be used in some capacity. Next, I will publish an improved upon version of this project with Hardhat running on the backend, which will allow much easier deployment, testing, and compiling of smart contracts. In addition, a server will be present, allowing for a login and registration system to come into effect.
